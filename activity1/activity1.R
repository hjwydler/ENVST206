6^6 #6 to the power of six = 46656

                      #Activity 1, Question 3

#Calculation 1:
x <- c(1667, 20, 12000, 1999) #creating a vector (x) w/ size of 4

x*4 # =multiplying vector by 4, [6668, 80, 48000, 7996]

#Calculation 2:

y <- 10 #setting value of 'y' to 10

y*50 #multiplying y by 50, =500

#Calculation 3: 
z <- 1.54 #setting value of z to 1.54

z*2 #multiplying z * 2, =3.08
